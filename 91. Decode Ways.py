Problem Reduction: variation of n-th staircase with n = [1, 2] steps.

Approach: We generate a bottom up DP table.

The tricky part is handling the corner cases (e.g. s = "30").

Most elegant way to deal with those error/corner cases, is to allocate an extra space, dp[0].

Let dp[ i ] = the number of ways to parse the string s[1: i + 1]

For example:
s = "231"
index 0: extra base offset. dp[0] = 1
index 1: # of ways to parse "2" => dp[1] = 1
index 2: # of ways to parse "23" => "2" and "23", dp[2] = 2
index 3: # of ways to parse "231" => "2 3 1" and "23 1" => dp[3] = 2

def numDecodings(s): 
	if not s:
		return 0

	dp = [0 for x in range(len(s) + 1)] 
	
	# base case initialization
	dp[0] = 1 
	dp[1] = 0 if s[0] == "0" else 1   #(1)

	for i in range(2, len(s) + 1): 
		# One step jump
		if 0 < int(s[i-1:i]) <= 9:    #(2)
			dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
		# Two step jump
		if 10 <= int(s[i-2:i]) <= 26: #(3)
			dp[i] += dp[i - 2]
	return dp[len(s)]
Notes of Wisdom:
(1): Handling s starting with '0'. Alternative: I would recommend treating as an error condition and immediately returning 0. It's easier to keep track and it's an optimization.
(2) (3): Pay close attention to your comparators. For (1) you want 0 <, not 0 <= . For (2) you want 10 <=, not 10 <
