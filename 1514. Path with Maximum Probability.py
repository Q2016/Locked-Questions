Q & A
Q1: Why negative weights can be used in Dijkstra's algorithm here in Python 3 code? I thought it's not allowed.
A1: Excellent question, negative weight is used ONLY in heapq to order its priority by reversed weight order. In fact, when calculating Prob., we still use positive value -prob.
Q2: Why Belman Ford actually works when vertices and edges can be as large as 10000 and 20000, respectively? If algo is O(n * E) it would be at least 200 000 000 operations, which is too much.
A2: - credit to @Binga45: O(n * E) is a very loose upper bound, and the code actually prunes enough branches to make itself run fast; Specifically, the bellman ford code won't add already visited vertices in most of the scenarios as we are enforcing below condition before adding to the queue.

	if (p[cur] * succProb[index] > p[neighbor]) {
		p[neighbor] = p[cur] * succProb[index];
		q.offer(neighbor);
	}
So, let's imagine an edge v-t and the probability connecting them to be 1. We have visited vand based on probability p[v], we updated p[t] also to the same value as p[v] as the edge connecting them has a prob of 1. Now, when we add t to the queue, we won't revisit the already visited neighbor v as p[t] * 1 is not > p[v].

The only exception to the above scenario is when we have another vertex u in the same level(depth) as v with a p[u] > p[v] and probability of edge u-t is 1. Then, we will revisit v from t, because in this scenario, p[t] * 1 > p[v] as p[t] is updated by u vertex. -- credit to @Binga45

Bellman Ford:

Initialize all vertices probabilities as 0, except start, which is 1;
Use BFS to traverse all reachable vertices from start, update the corresponding probilities whenever we can have a higher probability; otherwise, ignore that vertex; Note: when forwarding one step, multiply the corresponding succProb value with the probaboility of current vertex;
Repeat 2 till all probabilities reach their maximum values.
Return the probability of end as solution.
