A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell (i.e. blue cell).
Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.
You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. 
All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
