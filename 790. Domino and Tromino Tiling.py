Question:
You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.
Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board.
In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent 
cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
