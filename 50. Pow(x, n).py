Question:
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n.    
















Solution: Recursive, Iterative

If we have very small value of x we can directly return 0, the smallest value of float is 1.175494 Ã— 10^(-38).    
    
Recursive:
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x, n):
        def helper(x, n):
            if x==0: return 0
            if n==0: return 1
            
            res =helper(x*x, n//2)
            return x*res if n%2 else res
        
        res=helper(x, abs(n))
        return res if n>=0 else 1/res

Time is O(log n)    
    

Iterative:

    def myPow(self, x, n):
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        pow = 1
        while n:
            if n & 1:
                pow *= x
            x *= x
            n >>= 1
        return pow
    
since you're dividing N by 2 every iteration that's why it is O(Log N). However, since N is a fixed number of bits (32) you could 
view it as O(1) where the maximum number iterations is 32. Hope this helps.
