Question:
You are given an integer array of length n that represents a permutation of the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
We split array into some number of chunks, and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, 
the result should equal the sorted array. Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Solution: (I had the same idea as this solution!)   

left max and right min    
    
Algorithm: Iterate through the array, each time all elements to the left are smaller (or equal) to all elements to the right, there is a new chunck.
Use two arrays to store the left max and right min to achieve O(n) time complexity. Space complexity is O(n) too.
This algorithm can be used to solve ver2 too.

Java
class Solution {
    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] maxOfLeft = new int[n];
        int[] minOfRight = new int[n];

        maxOfLeft[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            maxOfLeft[i] = Math.max(maxOfLeft[i-1], arr[i]);
        }

        minOfRight[n - 1] = arr[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            minOfRight[i] = Math.min(minOfRight[i + 1], arr[i]);
        }

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (maxOfLeft[i] <= minOfRight[i + 1]) res++;
        }

        return res + 1;
    }
}
