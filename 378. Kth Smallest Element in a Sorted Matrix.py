Question:
Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element. You must find a solution with a memory 
complexity better than O(n^2).

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1, 5, 9 ],
                 [10,11,13],
                 [12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13    



Solution: BST
    
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])  # For general, the matrix need not be a square

        def countLessOrEqual(x):
            cnt = 0
            c = n - 1  # start with the rightmost column
            for r in range(m):
                while c >= 0 and matrix[r][c] > x: c -= 1  # decrease column until matrix[r][c] <= x
                cnt += (c + 1)
            return cnt

        left, right = matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        ans = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if countLessOrEqual(mid) >= k:
                ans = mid
                right = mid - 1  # try to looking for a smaller value in the left side
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # try to looking for a bigger value in the right side

        return ans
