Four conditions I doubt for the while-loop:

odd and odd.next -> wrong when 1->2->3->4->None ( even nodes ) because even.next is None, which has no attribute 'next'
odd and even.next -> wrong when 1->2->3->4->5->None ( odd nodes ) because even is None, which has no attribute 'next'
even and odd.next -> wrong when 1->2->3->4->None ( even nodes ) because even.next is None, which has no attribute 'next'
even and even.next -> correct
1. when 1->2->3->4->5->None ( odd nodes ) even will become None first and at the same time, odd points at the last node 
of the linked list; therefore, breaks from the while loop.
2. when 1->2->3->4->None ( even nodes ) even.next will become None first and at the same time, odd points at the last-2 
node of the linked list and even points at the last node of the linked list; therefore, breaks from the while loop.
