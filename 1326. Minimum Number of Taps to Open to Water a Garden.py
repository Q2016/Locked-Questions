Question:
There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e The length of the garden is n).
There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.
Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area 
[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.
Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]













Solution:
We build a list max_range to store the max range it can be watered from each index.
Then it becomes Jump Game II, where we want to find the minimum steps to jump from 0 to n.
The only difference is Jump Game II guarantees we can jump to the last index but this one not. 
We need to additionally identify the unreachable cases.




    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        max_range = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i, r in enumerate(ranges):
            left, right = max(0, i - r), min(n, i + r)
            max_range[left] = max(max_range[left], right - left)
        
		    # it's a jump game now
        start = end = step = 0
        
        while end < n:
            step += 1
            start, end = end, max(i + max_range[i] for i in range(start, end + 1))
            if start == end:
                return -1
            
        return step
