Question:
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values. 
-1~wall, 
0~gate, 
INF~empty room.  
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.
For example, given the 2D grid turns to:

INF  -1  0  INF   =>    3  -1   0   1
INF INF INF  -1         2   2   1  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1         1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1 INF INF         0  -1   3   4

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Solution: DFS, BFS

To find the neareast distance to the gate of each empty cell, we can start from the gate and use dfs to walk through each 
reachable cell. This will also give the distance for the current cell to the current gate. If there is another gate, we will 
use the dfs again to walk through each empty cell again and if the current cellâ€™s distance is more close to the current gate, 
then we update the distance for the current cell.
