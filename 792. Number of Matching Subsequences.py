Question:
Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s. A subsequence of a string is a new 
string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
Solution:
