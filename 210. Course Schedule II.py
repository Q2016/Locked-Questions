Question:
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must 
take course bi first if you want to take course ai. Return the ordering of courses you should take 
to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. 
 
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. 
Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].    






Solution: Topological Sorted Order + DFS

    WHITE = 1
    GRAY = 2
    BLACK = 3

        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        # A pair [a, b] in the input represents edge from b --> a
        for dest, src in prerequisites:
            adj_list[src].append(dest)

        topological_sorted_order = []
        is_possible = True

        # By default all vertces are WHITE
        color = {k: Solution.WHITE for k in range(numCourses)}

            nonlocal is_possible

            # Don't recurse further if we found a cycle already
            if not is_possible:

            color[node] = Solution.GRAY

            # Traverse on neighboring vertices
            if node in adj_list:
                for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                    if color[neighbor] == Solution.WHITE:
                        dfs(neighbor)
                    elif color[neighbor] == Solution.GRAY:
                         # An edge to a GRAY vertex represents a cycle
                        is_possible = False

            # Recursion ends. We mark it as black
            color[node] = Solution.BLACK
            topological_sorted_order.append(node)

        for vertex in range(numCourses):
            # If the node is unprocessed, then call dfs on it.
            if color[vertex] == Solution.WHITE:
                dfs(vertex)

        return topological_sorted_order[::-1] if is_possible else []
