Approach #1: Row and Column Maximums [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm

The skyline looking from the top is col_maxes = [max(column_0), max(column_1), ...]. 
Similarly, the skyline from the left is row_maxes [max(row_0), max(row_1), ...]

In particular, each building grid[r][c] could become height min(max(row_r), max(col_c)), 
and this is the largest such height. If it were larger, say grid[r][c] > max(row_r), then 
the part of the skyline row_maxes = [..., max(row_r), ...] would change.

These increases are also independent (none of them change the skyline), so we can perform them independently.

class Solution(object):
    def maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(self, grid):
        row_maxes = [max(row) for row in grid]
        col_maxes = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]

        return sum(min(row_maxes[r], col_maxes[c]) - val
                   for r, row in enumerate(grid)
                   for c, val in enumerate(row))
                   
Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the number of rows (and columns) of the grid. We iterate through every cell of the grid.

Space Complexity: O(N), the space used by row_maxes and col_maxes.
