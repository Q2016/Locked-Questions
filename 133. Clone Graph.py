Question:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph. Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). 
 
Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).


Solution: DFS or BFS
    
DFS iteratively    
    def cloneGraph1(self, node):
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            n = stack.pop()
            for neigh in n.neighbors:
                if neigh not in m:
                    stack.append(neigh)
                    m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                m[n].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
        return m[node]
        
        
BFS        
    def cloneGraph2(self, node): 
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        deque = collections.deque([node])
        while deque:
            n = deque.popleft()
            for neigh in n.neighbors:
                if neigh not in m:
                    deque.append(neigh)
                    m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                m[n].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
        return m[node]
        
        
        
DFS recursively

    def cloneGraph(self, node): 
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        self.dfs(node, m)
        return m[node]
    
    def dfs(self, node, m):
        for neigh in node.neighbors:
            if neigh not in m:
                m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                self.dfs(neigh, m)
            m[node].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
