Subsequence: Input: “apb” Output: “a,” “p,” “b,” “ap,” “pb,” “ab,” “apb,” and. “” 
subarray/substring: For example, “is a rainy” is a substring of “Today is a rainy day.”

For these questions I like to see their youtube:

Time complexity of Fibonatci:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-recursive-fibonacci-program/

- For dfs we have the time complexity as O(V+E)

- For every DFS problem (top-down) first check if it can reduced to subproblems, this will make it a DP problem with reduced time complexity (bottom-up)
