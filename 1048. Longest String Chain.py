Question:
For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, 
word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on.    

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].

    
Solution: DP

Explanation
Sort the words by word's length. (also can apply bucket sort)
For each word, loop on all possible previous word with 1 letter missing.
If we have seen this previous word, update the longest chain for the current word.
Finally return the longest word chain.    



def longestStrChain(self, words):
    dp = {}
    for w in sorted(words, key=len):
        dp[w] = max(dp.get(w[:i] + w[i + 1:], 0) + 1 for i in xrange(len(w)))
    return max(dp.values())




class Solution {
public:

    static bool compare(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        return s1.length() < s2.length();
    }

    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), compare);
        unordered_map<string, int> dp;
        int res = 0;
        for (string w : words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                string pre = w.substr(0, i) + w.substr(i + 1);
                dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp.find(pre) == dp.end() ? 1 : dp[pre] + 1);
            }
            res = max(res, dp[w]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};




Complexity
Time O(NlogN) for sorting,
Time O(NSS) for the for loop, where the second S refers to the string generation and S <= 16.
Space O(NS)
