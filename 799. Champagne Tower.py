Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]
Intuition

Instead of keeping track of how much champagne should end up in a glass, keep 
track of the total amount of champagne that flows through a glass. For example, 
if poured = 10 cups are poured at the top, then the total flow-through of the top 
glass is 10; the total flow-through of each glass in the second row is 4.5, and so on.

Algorithm

In general, if a glass has flow-through X, then Q = (X - 1.0) / 2.0 quantity of champagne 
will equally flow left and right. We can simulate the entire pour for 100 rows of glasses. 
A glass at (r, c) will have excess champagne flow towards (r+1, c) and (r+1, c+1).


class Solution(object):
    def champagneTower(self, poured, query_row, query_glass):
        A = [[0] * k for k in xrange(1, 102)]
        A[0][0] = poured
        for r in xrange(query_row + 1):
            for c in xrange(r+1):
                q = (A[r][c] - 1.0) / 2.0
                if q > 0:
                    A[r+1][c] += q
                    A[r+1][c+1] += q

        return min(1, A[query_row][query_glass])
