Question:
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
A valid BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Solution:
Use recursion. Pass down two parameters: lessThan (which means that all nodes in the 
the current subtree must be smaller than this value) and largerThan (all must be larger 
than it). Compare root of the current subtree with these two values. Then, recursively 
check the left and right subtree of the current one. Take care of the values passed down.

class Solution(object):
    def isValidBST(self, root, lessThan = float('inf'), largerThan = float('-inf')):
        if not root:
            return True
        if root.val <= largerThan or root.val >= lessThan:
            return False
        return self.isValidBST(root.left, min(lessThan, root.val), largerThan) and \
               self.isValidBST(root.right, lessThan, max(root.val, largerThan))
