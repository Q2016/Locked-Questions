Question:
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.
Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal    















Solution: BFS

Use BFS to find the sum of each level, then locate the level with largest sum.    
    
    
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        max, level, maxLevel = -float('inf'), 0, 0
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)
        while q:
            level += 1
            sum = 0
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                sum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            if max < sum:
                max, maxLevel = sum, level        
        return maxLevel
