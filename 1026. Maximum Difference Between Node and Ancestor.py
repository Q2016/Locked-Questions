Question:
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different 
nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.
A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

Example 1:
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.    











Brute force DFS recursion

Solution: Maximum Minus Minimum (seems like a pre/post order)

Given any two nodes on the same root-to-leaf path, they must have the required ancestor relationship.
Therefore, we just need to record the maximum and minimum values of all root-to-leaf paths and return the maximum difference.
To achieve this, we can record the maximum and minimum values during the recursion and return the difference when encountering leaves.


    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        def helper(node, cur_max, cur_min):
            # if encounter leaves, return the max-min along the path
            if not node:
                return cur_max - cur_min
            # else, update max and min
            # and return the max of left and right subtrees
            cur_max = max(cur_max, node.val)
            cur_min = min(cur_min, node.val)
            left = helper(node.left, cur_max, cur_min)
            right = helper(node.right, cur_max, cur_min)
            return max(left, right)

        return helper(root, root.val, root.val)
