Question:
You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.
You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island. Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.    


Solution:
Idea is straightforward.
We get root of first island from "first" function
We dfs root and add indexes to bfs
We bfs and expand the first island in other words
Finally return step number when facing other island
Note: This can also be done with referenced array if you don't want to modify A.
    
class Solution:
    def shortestBridge(self, A):
        def dfs(i, j):
            A[i][j] = -1
            bfs.append((i, j))
            for x, y in ((i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)):
                if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and A[x][y] == 1:
                    dfs(x, y)
        def first():
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    if A[i][j]:
                        return i, j
        n, step, bfs = len(A), 0, []
        dfs(*first())
        while bfs:
            new = []
            for i, j in bfs:
                for x, y in ((i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)):
                    if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n:
                        if A[x][y] == 1:
                            return step
                        elif not A[x][y]:
                            A[x][y] = -1
                            new.append((x, y))
            step += 1
            bfs = new
