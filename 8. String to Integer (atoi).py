Question:
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines 
if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as 
necessary (from step 2).

If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, 
integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1. 

Return the integer as the final result.

Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
 
      

        
Solution:
                                                                                             
'12345' => 12345 (integer is in 32-bit range)
'9999999999999' => 2^31-1 (integer overflow)
'-999999999999' => -2^31   (integer underflow)
                                                                                             
How to check overflows/underflows?

If we were using a long, BigInteger, or any other numeric data types to store the integers, we could check if the integer exceeds the 32-bit range, 
stop building the output number, and return the clamped value.

num = num * 10 + digit
if num > 2^31 - 1 then return 2^31 - 1
else if num < -2^31 then return -2^31
However, here we will assume our environment doesn't allow us to use these data types which could be a constraint imposed by the interviewer. 
But we can't directly use a 32-bit integer to store the final result.

For example, assume currently result is 1000000000 and digit is 1, we can't append the current digit to result as 10000000001 is more than 2^31âˆ’1. 
So, performing the result = result * 10 + digit operation will result in Runtime Error.

Hence, first we need to check if appending the digit to the result is safe or not. If it is safe to append then update the result. Otherwise, 
handle the overflow/underflow.

Let's first consider the case for overflow.

We will denote the maximum 32-bit integer value 2^{31} - 1 = 21474836472 with INT_MAX, and we will append the digits one by one to the final number.

So there could be 3 cases:

Case 1: If the current number is less than INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364, we can append any digit, and the new number will always be less than INT_MAX.
'214748363' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '0' = '2147483630' (less than INT_MAX)
'214748363' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '9' = '2147483639' (less than INT_MAX)
'1' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '9' = '19' (less than INT_MAX) 
Case 2: If the current number is more than INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364, appending any digit will result in a number greater than INT_MAX.
'214748365' + '0' = '2147483650' (more than INT_MAX)
'214748365' + '9' = '2147483659' (more than INT_MAX)
'2147483646' + '8' = '21474836468' (more than INT_MAX)
Case 3: If the current number is equal to INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364, we can only append digits from 0-7 such that the new number will always be 
less than or equal to INT_MAX.
'214748364' + '0' = '2147483640' (which is less than INT_MAX)
'214748364' + '7' = '2147483647' (which is equal to INT_MAX)
'214748364' + '8' = '2147483648' (which is more than INT_MAX)

Similarly for underflow.
The minimum 32-bit integer value is -2^{31}=-2147483648 denote it with INT_MIN.

We append the digits one by one to the final number.
Just like before, there could be 3 cases:

Case 1: If the current number is greater than INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364, then we can append any digit and the new number will always be 
greater than INT_MIN.

Case 2: If the current number is less than INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364, appending any digit will result in a number less than INT_MIN.

Case 3: If the current number is equal to INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364, then we can only append digits from 0-8, such that the new number 
will always be greater than or equal to INT_MIN.
Notice that cases 1 and 2 are similar for overflow and underflow. The only difference is case 3: for overflow, we can append any digit 
between 0 and 7, but for underflow, we can append any digit between 0 and 8.

So we can combine both the underflow and overflow checks as follows:

Initially, store the sign for the final result and consider only the absolute values to build the integer and return the final result with 
a correct sign at the end.
If the current number is less than 214748364 = (INT_MAX / 10), we can append the next digit.
If the current number is greater than 214748364:
And, the sign for the result is '+', then the result will overflow, so return INT_MAX;
Or, the sign for the result is '-', then the result will underflow, so return INT_MIN.
If the current number is equal to 214748364:
If the next digit is between 0-7, the result will always be in range.
If, next digit is 8:
and the sign is '+' the result will overflow, so return INT_MAX;
if the sign is '-', the result will not underflow but will still be equal to INT_MIN, so that we can return INT_MIN.
But if, the next digit is greater than 8:
and the sign is '+' the result will overflow, so return INT_MAX;
if the sign is '-', the result will underflow, so return INT_MIN.

                return INT_MAX if sign == 1 else INT_MIN

Complexity Analysis
If N is the number of characters in the input string.
Time complexity: O(N)
We visit each character in the input at most once and for each character we spend a constant amount of time.
Space complexity: O(1)
We have used only constant space to store the sign and the result.
